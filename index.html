		<h1>Project Hero</h1>
		<div id="content"></div>
		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>A fun little side project that I got carried away with. Hint: look in the console for now. World.tick() will advance the world. Inspect the world to see what has happened.</p>
		<h2>What are those swirling colours?</h2>
		<p>The map. Calculated using relative values, representing the density of monsters, heroes, and towns as R, G, and B repsectively. So then, in a world with a tile of 2 and 1 monsters, the 1st tile would be fully bright, while the second would only be as half as bright.</p>
